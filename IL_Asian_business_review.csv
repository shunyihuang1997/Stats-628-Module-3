The first few times were really good. The last few have not been. At all. The hot and sour soup is great, and the steamed dumplings are very tasty. However, while the egg rolls are giant, they don't have much flavor. I do like their crab rangoon; they're a little on the sweeter side as opposed to the onion-flavored side. I quit ordering their egg drop soup because it kept coming with yolky-like, slimy lumps in it. The last time I ordered it, I literally had several tablespoons of this uncooked funk in the bottom of the container. I have issues with some textures, and that was just gross! My mom orders veggie lo mein, and she said she was done ordering it there. It just tasted greasy when I tried hers. My dad and I both tried a seafood dish the last time, and we both enjoyed it.

A previous time we got delivery they forgot an egg roll and a pork fried rice. When I called back they credited me for those missing items. When my wife and I went in to order takeout they scrambled around trying to find our credit... there was a wall with sticky notes all over it. I guess that's how they keep track of their mess ups. Great system. Eventually we got the two free items we had been promised. Then as we were leaving my wife decided to check the bags and we were still missing theeggg roll.

I read the reviews and most are all positive.  However, looking at the dates of the reviews, show that the the place did well the first year of existence. 

Today, we decide to eat here thinking it would be a good decision base on the reviews.  How sadly mistaken we were with our choice.  There was only one customer and she was seated closest to the door.  I would know why shortly after ordering and finding a seat.  The menu is small and nothing to be excited.  The owners had their kids there playing video games in the dining area which was annoying.  They all must live near by cause their kids bikes were outside and inside the restaurant.  The worst part was a child behind the counter taking our order.  We assumed this was because the child was the only one who could speak English.  I should have mentioned to the owners about child labor laws cause he was the only one working the dining room.  He brought our food out and cleaned the table where the other customer was seated.  Oh and she left quickly when one of the kids ran around like it was a play ground area.  I understood why she sat closest to the door. 

Now to the food.  Nothing exciting here!  Very typical Chinese food in the metro east.  I wonder why all the Chinese food taste the same on this side of the river.  I go over to St Louis Grand BLVD and food there are so much better and authentic.  I have this belief that all the Chinese restaurants on this side of the river are owned by the same Chinese clan.  

This place should not be a restaurant.  We told ourselves that never will we ever step foot in this establishment again.  Their only positive is that the food came out fast.

Ate there when I found a menu in my door (which I hate).  BEYOND pleasantly surprised. 

I order from there CONSTANTLY and neither me or my family has EVER had a bad thing off the menu

Mai Fun is my favorite.   AND.....just like you can get a side order of egg Foo young gravy,  at Li, you can get a side of General Tso's sauce!!!!!!!!

AND you can order online.   I've been in a few times when just passing by and their children work there too.  And they couldn't be more pleasant

Would have been a 5 star rating but I still hate the delivery times...about 45-60 minutes and I'm right off Mascoutah Ave. .

Oh well, no one has it all, right?  And I'll take quality over an extra 15-30 minutes any day

So.....we ordered food for 8 people.  All the people that got fried rice, said it was horrible...like a big box of flavorless grease.  One person, who hit extra extra hot Kung pal chicken, said it was to flavor and spice what rice cakes is to fat...I got my Mai Fun.  It was someone else's Fun.  Because it wasn't mine.  Dumplings were HORRIBLE.

AND THEN INMADE THE MISTAKE OF CALLING THIS MORNING TO TALK TO SOMEONE IN CHARGE.  THEY COULDN'T have cared less.  And the height of their disinterest was that they would replace the food with $5 off my order if and only if, I ordered RIGHT THEN.......today is the day before Thanksgiving and I'm running like 10 million errands IN MY CAR

I said all that to say this......I have no job but I'm willing to pay people NOT TO PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  That's how strongly I feel about it.

The Chicken Lo Mein was nothing to run their screaming for it was a little bland and I absolutely dislike their fried rice.  Yes it has pork in it, i know you don't get that in too many places, but it had absolutely no flavor what so ever.

The egg roll was ginormous, i mean seriously massive.  it was just okay, i would not get again, but it was big enough to almost fill me up alone.

The portions were huge! I think it could feed four easy off one plate, so beware.

They have the standard pictures you see at any eat in and takeout chinese strip mall place.  Take that picture and double the size that is what you get for $6.99, amazing deal.

i do know they say they have 25 plates for lunch for 5.99 includes soup, egg roll and a soda, if you don't want a soda its only 4.99.  I'm assuming the portion size isn't much smaller than the dinner size according to the other reviews.

The waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish.  They ask you on a scale of 1 to 4.  First visit I asked for 3 and the dish was very nice.  Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a ""sinus opening experience"" the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.

The menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being ""not fresh"" I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I've had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.

Each visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.

Walk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.

I've been to Thailand a few times and while you'll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.  It's where I'll be taking my out-of-town guests and where I'll go for takeout when the urge hits.

It is located in a new strip mall just off highway 64's Green Mount  Rd. exit in O'Fallon, IL (less than a half hour drive from St. Louis).  It is nicely decorated, simple, earthy, and contemporary.

They have a few Chinese items on the menu, but it is primarily Thai.  I had the pleasure of doing a curry taste test at a recent Thai festival in Florrisant and Sala Thai was the best by far.  It is good to know their cook is carrying on the good cooking at a newer & nicer location!  

Today, we sampled the tofu yellow curry, pad Thai, Thai sweet & sour shrimp, & Thai cashew chicken.  The Thai version of these dishes has more complex flavor combinations and is lighter and more delicious than simlar dishes from some of their Asian counterparts.  I loved it all!

Vegetarians will like Aroy, as well.  They have a large selection of interesting and tasty vegetarian items.

The food service is a wee bit slow and the items are priced a little high, but it is absolutely yummy!  My only real complaint is that it is small and they get packed early.  So give yourself some time.

I walked in and saw that the interior is very nice. All dark wood tables and chairs. 

I ordered the springrolls as an appetizer, and the curry chicken fried rice as an entree. the spring rolls came out almost immediately. i said ""wow that was fast."" the waitress said well they are premade. The sweet chili peanut sauce was good, but i think it may have been out of a jar. it tasted like the sauce we have at work. the spring rolls were large and i got 4 of them for $5. I would have liked it better to get 2 and had shrimp in them. i barely ate one roll and here came my entree. at this point i am mildly perturbed. The curry fried rice was good also, but everything tasted premade.As if you order, and then they take a cup of this and a smidge of that. I spent $24 on one meal. i want it made fresh from start to end. the tea was ok but had an they need to clean the nozzles taste to it. i expected more and got disappointed a bit.

We headed over here on late on Saturday night.  The place was pretty full, but we had great timing because a few tables got up at once.  All we had to wait was 5 minutes or so.  It started going downhill when the waitress took our order and seemed very indifferent.  In fact my friend tried to order a drink and she walked away!  We called her back and all saw her do a very loud annoyed sigh at him!  Geez, I didn't think taking an order was that much of an inconvenience!  Three of us got our food together, but the fourth person had to ask after 5 more minutes of waiting.  Once she got her dish and I was able to start mine, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was (I had the Pad Prik-Khing)!  We all tried a bit of everyone else's dish and they were all delicious.  After we all ate we sat and waited......

and waited some more.  We waited for I'd say about 30 minutes after we were done eating just to get the check---and the only reason we got it was because we asked another waitress.

What's great is that they have lunch specials which make the prices more decent and acceptable. I tried the Green Curry with chicken at a spice level of 4 for $7.99. My hubby tried the Pad See Ew with chicken at a spice level of 1 for also $7.99. Both lunch items came with two pieces of Crab Rangoon and of course steamed rice. You can choose to sub stuff with an extra charge. I also got a Thai iced tea which I think was $2.99.

So I really liked everything that we got, they were cooked well and tasted really great. Very comparable to all the other great Thai restaurants that I've been to. The only thing is that there wasn't really anything new so nothing really blew my mind. I mean there's nothing wrong with that as long as what they serve is quality. What I did like is that you could choose the level of spiciness you wanted for your dish, I chose the level 4 and for me it was great but actually it wasn't that spicy overall. Just watch out especially if you are more sensitive to spicy stuff though because I just really love spicy food.

As for the service it was pretty good. The server was nice and the food came out really quick!

The pad Thai with chicken was good and a great quantity for 2 meals which for me is always a plus. The $7.89 lunch portion came with 2 crab Rangoon which were good and freshly cooked. Sometimes the crab Rangoon can taste old and be cold since some places fry more than they should at a time. 
I also had the opportunity to try Thai ice tea which honestly did not blow me away. It looked pretty and refreshing- seeing a customer with a tall glass of ice with this location lightly brown and slightly orange drink prompted me to ask the waitress what it was, and she told me Thai iced tea. 
I got one to go. It was basically a black tea with milk and was sweet. It had a little lingering taste I couldn't quite describe- almost like overly brewed strong tea, so it wasn't quite bitterness, but I don't know how else to describe it. It was different. 

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was the pad Thai did not have any fresh garnish accompaniments- no shredded carrots or cabbage, no tablespoon of finely chopped peanuts. This is the only place in the area I have visited that doesn't have that, and I like to mix in the fresh garnish with the hot steaming pad Thai.

When I called the hostess over and inquired about a vegetable soup versus this chicken, she went over to ask the manager. He told her I would be charged with for the soup but can order something else then he left and refused to come back out. It was a horrible unprofessional way to handle a customer who had been there a 2nd time.

Anyway, I found  a better Thai place that treats the customer right and has better food about 2 miles away on Rt 50......I'm taking my business there and would suggest that if you prefer to dine at a location where the customer actually matters and isn't an inconvenience to an immature, distracted and arrogant service staff, don't go to this nasty little place - they just aren't worth the abuse....btw, their egg rolls stink...mostly fried wrapper about 1/4"" in diameter with hardly anything inside - I can honestly say they were the absolute worst egg rolls I've ever eaten anywhere...another good reason to avoid this bad restaurant...

Presentation of the food was neatly and cleanly packed no excessive amounts of sauce or oil. 

Taste- I ordered the Pad Thai with pork, chicken satay, sweet rice with custard, and Thai ice tea.

Pad thai- flavor was okay was missing a lot of key flavors im used to tasting in pad Thai. Would love if it came with a side of pepper flake and fresh lime to brighten up the dish. All in all not something I would order again

Chicken Satay- Perfectly seasoned and the addition of a peanut sauce with just the right amount of spicy was wonderful. The pickled cucumbers were a great way to enhance the flavor. 

Sweet rice with custard- Taste wise this was a great dessert. The custard was not overly sweetened and blended nicely with the sticky rice and coconut milk. However pretty sure this was prepackaged and then heated in a microwave as the container was a tad bit melted on the bottom and the rice had some really crispy edges.

Thai ice tea- really hard to mess this one up. It was perfect and not overly filled with ice. Perfect drink to wrap up the meal.

Initially they were a solid 3.5 star.....but we noticed they were pretty pricey compared to other/similar establishments in the region. This is not coming from someone afraid to pay more for consistent quality, and we pretty much stopped eating there because they obviously were not paying attention to quality.
What do I mean lack of quality you ask? 

1.) Undercooked/or stale rice
2.) Flavorless rubber chicken 
(I'm referring to chicken that is NOT breaded and fried aka Orange chicken etc)
3.) While heat may be requested, Sauces and Broth are VERY bland compared to other Thai restaurants food in the region
4.) Appetizer Combo= Overly cooked fried items and ""Summer rolls"" that consist of big mac level lettuce and a few carrot strands And Thats All!

So Recently we decided lets give Aroy Thai another chance.
Upon entry I noticed that the once slick and stylish looking restaurant interior is now dingy and clearly not maintained. Entry carpets dirty and unswept, once black tables are all scratched and dingy (Mind you these tables were likely painted to begin with... but no one has made the effort to maintain)

Waitress/staff including management are obviously disinterested in patrons while taking your order and even more never returned to the table to enquire as to the foods quality or in this case the lack there of. 

Sadly food quality hasn't changed for the better but quite the opposite. She confirmed Her soup dish was not good, my Thai Fried rice, while it had heat, was indeed stale/undercooked and the chicken literally tasted as if I had took a chunk out of the tire on my car and chewed on it!

I ate very little, and did not complain (as I really don't like to complain to staff) 
 I'm guessing however  Im not the only one that has paid their bill almost as a right of passage out the door so the owner doesn't have you arrested vs something you willingly pay for because you truly enjoyed the meal? 

Remember that give them a chance statement?.... we did... and sadly we are finished!

Thankfully there are other far better Thai restaurants in our area!",4575,Aroy Thai,1140 Central Park Dr,O Fallon,IL,62269,38.5738228,-89.9310173,3.5,157,1,"Thai, Restaurants","{'Monday': '11:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:0'}",True,True,True,False,2,True,False,u'full_bar',False,False,True,u'average',u'casual',True,u'no',True,,,True,,,,,,,,,,True,False,,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,False,False,True,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,12:0-21:0,12:0-21:0

My sister and I were in the mood for Thai since it's fresh and on the lighter side. Because our hotel is right by Aroy Thai, we decided to check this place out. 

The staff was so-so. Some of the waitresses were very nice (saying ""welcome take a seat anywhere you would like"" and ""enjoy your holidays"" when you left) but our server seemed to be kind of rude- she filled our water glasses without saying hello or giving a smile, and she hardly gave my sister and I any time to look over the menu- she filled the water, walked away, came back and said ""are you ready to order"" not even 5 minutes later. 

I quickly chose the Pad Thai with tofu and added vegetables to it. About 10 minutes later, both my sister's and my entree came out. 2 entrees made in 10 minutes? Something's a bit fishy there. It just doesn't seem possible to make 2 entrees from scratch in less than 10 minutes without using a microwave. And I could tell by the taste of the food too. The pad thai was bland and didn't have that sweet & tangy taste like pad thai should have. It had no peanuts in it either, which is a part of pad thai. The tofu and vegetables were mushy. And, Aroy's idea of making a dish spicy is using cayenne pepper powder and not using authentic Thai chili peppers. The cayenne pepper powder would just clump up in the noodles, which shows a lack of effort to make a dish spicy and authentic. Sad!

I would not recommend Aroy Thai because of the lack of flavor, spice, and authenticity of  their food.",4575,Aroy Thai,1140 Central Park Dr,O Fallon,IL,62269,38.5738228,-89.9310173,3.5,157,1,"Thai, Restaurants","{'Monday': '11:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:0'}",True,True,True,False,2,True,False,u'full_bar',False,False,True,u'average',u'casual',True,u'no',True,,,True,,,,,,,,,,True,False,,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,False,False,True,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,12:0-21:0,12:0-21:0

Con: Spiciness is important to me. If I ask for your hottest option and I still need to add hot sauce, something's off the mark. Mind you, I may have a problem. I like everything spicy! I just want a bit more from my Thai food. Also, the spacing comes in two configurations: completely empty or ridiculously packed. Leave the office 5 minutes early to beat the lunch crowd.

The bf and I ventured over the river because this place came highly recommended to us by a nice lady and her husband. Well, we were not disappointed.

We did not order an appetizer but everything sounded tasty.

For our main courses we had:
Red Curry - fresh red chili, bamboo shoot, coconut milk, green pepper and basil with chicken. $9.95
&
Vegetarian Green Curry - fresh green chili, bamboo shoot, coconut, milk, green pepper, mushroom, eggplant, broccoli, peas, baby corn and basil with tofu. $9.95

Both curries were flavorful and smelled amazing. The veggies were fresh and the food came out uber fast.

The server was friendly and helpful. The ambiance was kind of whatever but it was clean. The spice level was LOW. I love spicy food and I ordered the highest level on the menu. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but it was not spicy. the bf doesn't like his food as spicy as I do and he said he could have handled the level of heat my curry was at.

I was a bit skeptical considering this was a small town Thai restaurant.  I met a friend there for dinner on a Wednesday night at around 6pm.  The place was buzzing.  Actually, the whole street was alive and parking was at a premium.  We walked in out of the cold and into the tight waiting area to be seated.  After a few minutes we were greeted and sat at a table nestled in a corner.  It was a cute place with Polaroids of customers lining the walls and a few Asian trinkets here and there.

Our waitress arrived and we were handed 2 incredibly odd menus that were almost like looking at an order form for car parts.  We ordered a couple of waters and they were promptly placed in front of us and we were asked if we were ready to order.  Not quite ready, we sent her away and studied our menus.  There was a fair amount to choose from, and a group of duck specialty items I would have normally gunned for if not for the whole one I roasted the night before.  Things started to pick up in the place and it was getting busy.  I could tell our server was in the weeds, and it took her a good while to get back to us for our order.  We did have our chance early, but wasted it catching up.  This wasn't the server's fault, but it looks as if they were caught a little off guard.

She returned, and we ordered a Dumpling Soup, Panang Curry, and some Crab Rangoon.  The Rangoon came out swiftly and was served with a light sweet and sour sauce with an yellow tinge.  These were pretty good, and much better than the frozen varieties that you get at those cookie cutter Chinese restaurants.  15 minutes after we finished our appetizer, the entrees arrived.  A large bowl of broth with sprouts and dumplings and a plate with chicken and veggies covered in a red sauce arrived at our table.  

The panang had a nice aroma and thick slices of green and red peppers.  I stirred it around and found a few leaves of really dark, wilted basil.  I took my first bite, which contained one of these leaves and there was something off.  The panang lacked kick, and that basil had an incredibly bitter flavor to it.  I took a few more bites and picked around the last few bits of basil.  It wasn't bad, but I've had much better in the freezer section of Trader Joe's.

My companion thought the dumpling soup was good, and allowed me to have a few bites.  The broth was heavy in garlic, which I liked, with little hints of cilantro and green onion.  I snagged another bite with a dumpling which was heavy on garlic as well and some crisp sprouts that added some texture.  It reminded me of Pho and I was craving some fresh herbs and rice noodles to go with it.  

Overall, this place wasn't bad.  It doesn't live up to any of the places over on S. Grand or even Sen Thai downtown.

While visiting some friends in nearby Waterloo, the discussion of 'where the hell are we going to eat before the Cardinals game' began.  Running through an endless list of fast food and local specialties, the decision for Thai food at the Thai House was made.  Thus we embarked.

The restaurant itself was a good size, clean, and inviting.  The menu was fairly diverse, and the end result was excellent.  I ordered the Thai House Noodles with crab.  I was pleasantly surprised with the dish I was provided.  The dish was delicious with lots of crab and the price was reasonable.

The menu is large, and I've yet to be disappointed. You can order food on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being extremely hot. I haven't had the gumption to try the 5, but 3 is plenty hot for me.

Went with my Family on 12/23/17 and food quality was sub-par.  We started with crab delights, they were ok, off a bit from usual.  My oldest Son had the beef gyoza's and beef sticks for his dinner.  He did not have an issue with the gyoza's but only ate one and a half of his beef sticks.  He told me that the texture was chewy and that they tasted different than normal.  I tried a beef stick and it was rubbery and did not taste as they usually do.  I have had the beef sticks before as well.  My younger Son's favorite place to eat is/was the Thai House.  He always orders the phad see lew with beef.  He ate maybe 1/4 of his meal and then told me that it just doesn't taste the same as normal.  I ordered the phad see lew with chicken, and if it wasn't for soy sauce I would not have been able to eat it.  The noodles were wet and slimy, not sticky and light as usual.  Make sense as to why my son didn't care for his beef phad see lew.  Same noodles, slimy and wet.  Hardly tasted any egg as well.  Broccoli was kind of meh as well.  My Wife ordered the Thai house noodles, and it was like a soup way over seasoned with some of the shrimp being hard and unable to eat.  My Wife has ordered the Thai house noodles before, tonight they were way off.  We were going to take the left over food home for our dogs and forgot the food on the table.  We didn't bother to go back in the restaurant to get the food left behind.  The restaurant was fairly busy during our visit, getting a refill for my drink was not timely as I order my food quite spicy.  Looks like we will be looking for a new Thai restaurant.  Probably will return to the Kind and I from now on.

The service is top notch.  Occasionally they have a new employee that takes a bit to get familiar with the place and the customers.  But after a few weeks they figure things out.  You can probably tell I am a regular.  The staff knows me and my friends and the additional things that we like with our meals.  The additional side sauces and how we like certain things prepared.  The fried gyoza is amazing.  Best fried dumplings I have ever had.  

On to the sushi.  We've had several ""experimental"" pieces that the chefs try out with customers.  What I love about Sake is that they will sometimes make new rolls and give them to you on the house.  Just to try them out with the patrons.  To get a feel for how they will be received.  That's how we tried the OMG, Mr. Lee, and another that isn't on the menu yet, doesn't have a name, but was my favorite to date.  They have given us all of the desserts over time too.  How can you beat that?  

My favorites are the OMG, Mr. Lee, Morrison, Spicy Bacon Crab, and Yummy roll.  They made one for me last week that was chicken and jalapeno.  That's my new favorite but it's not on the menu.  If you are in the area, definitely go to Sake.  A few weeks ago we went to Tatsu since Sake was closed (I really wish they were open on Sundays) and while it was good, it was not as good as Sake.

I mean seriously, I've read all the glowing reviews and I must say  I was not impressed at all with my first time experience with this so call Japanese sushi bar & grill. 
I ordered an assortment of their tempura appetizers, not only was I totally disappointed, it so awful I couldn't finish the platter and started looking around for some Tums. Now I have had tempora shrimp vegetables etc. And this was no where near being tempora. I'd been better off at Captain D's. The vegetables where squishy and overcooked, the so-called Tim hora batter did not stick to any other food it was very loose hard and coming off of the food. The shrimp was over cook dried out and chewy, and some of the vegetables you could just taste the oil. Their  sushi may be fine and I really did want to try some but I was getting sick from the tempura assortment. It ruined my appetite for the rest of the day. True temper should cover the food completely with a golden light crispy crest, when you bite into your food especially the vegetables they should have a little bit of a bite to them not mushy or overcooked, the shrimp should be juicy and tinder, not dried out and tough with the batter dripping off in your hands. The whole experience should be a light fresh taste, not greasy or oily. I was so disappointed that I didn't want to, I couldn't risk the entree.
Maybe it was just a bad day, it happens but if I ever should return I will not be ordering anything stating to be tempora, I would like to try some of their sushi creations but it will be awhile after I get the taste  of that abomination out of my mouth.",22565,Sake Sushi Bar and Grill,1325 Central Park Dr,O Fallon,IL,62269,38.589075,-89.945672,4.5,113,1,"Japanese, Restaurants, Sushi Bars","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '16:0-20:30', 'Wednesday': '16:0-20:30', 'Thursday': '16:0-20:30', 'Friday': '16:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-21:0'}",True,True,,True,2,False,False,u'full_bar',True,False,True,u'average',u'casual',True,'free',True,,,True,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,,False,,False,True,0:0-0:0,16:0-20:30,16:0-20:30,16:0-20:30,16:0-21:0,16:0-21:0,

Lately, it's been sushi. I just cannot get enough. As soon as I got home from work, I told my husband we had to get sushi for dinner...so we decided on Sake. As we walked in, he pointed out the sign for 10% off with an active duty military ID. This always makes me happy.

We were seated immediately (it was virtually vacant inside) and given our menus. I figured I was going to get my two usual rolls, but noticed something I had never seen in a sushi restaurant before: shiitake. Intrigued, Matthew and I each ordered one and got an additional veggie roll. I suppose no matter how cheap your roll is, you get complimentary soup and salad. Definitely a plus -- their salad is delicious. 

As our server brought us our rolls, I saw how enormous the veggie roll was. Seriously, one piece of this roll almost takes two bites and there were 6 pieces. One of my favorite aspects of a sushi roll is when it's given to me with warm rice. I enjoy the contrast between the coldness of the vegetables and the warmth of the rice. Temperature aside, these rolls were both scrumptious! I was quite impressed. To top everything off -- the check. Three rolls and my husband's Dr. Pepper totaled to $15 with the discount. Amazing.

I like the Cashew Chicken & Szechuan Beef.  My daughter enjoys the Lo Mein noodles and Wonton Soup.  The crab rangoon is very sweet and yummy.  We usually order those along with some egg rolls.  The egg rolls are large so 1 per person is about right.

Delivery is also available and they guys are always friendly and respectful.  They also take checks (from regulars) which is nice because I don't always have cash on me.

I have never had a bad experience with their food or service. Every employee I have met and/or spoken with has been extremely nice and polite. The food arrives FAST and is always hot and delicious. They always provide tons of sauce and fortune cookies. 

I only have two complaints with this location. Firstly, the pricing is a *little* high in comparison to others I've eaten with in the past, so once delivery fee is added its a bit steep. I'd argue that it is worth the price, but that's a personal decision and some may not agree. Secondly, online ordering seems to produce some confusion. Every time I've noted a small adjustment in the notes section (for example pure soy sauce as opposed to traditional soy ginger sauce with my fried dumplings) it never seems to make it through in my order.

Lunch specials are offered for $5.25 from open to 3pm daily. Their are extremely busy on Thursday/Friday and Saturday nights. 

The food isn't the best chinese that Ive tasted. My go to is Egg Fu Young, stay away from the fried rice, Im not sure what it is but it has a weird taste to me.

First of all three stars in my opinion is way too high of a rating for this place, please note I said place not restaurant. Now due to a cliche in the doordash software I wasn't able to order from my regular Chinese restaurants, so I figured why not try new china. Well my first order was a bit lackluster, wasn't impressed with their fried rice, lacked flavor and that all important umami, but maybe I just caught them on a off night. So a few days later I thought I'd give them another try. I was in the mood for some egg foo young and Chinese BBQ ribs. When I got my food I noticed that there was no container of gravy, so I immediately jumped on the horn to my driver to go back and get me the gravy that it was not included. Well to my surprise the gravy was already on my egg foo young, well there goes my crispy edges, so I immediately contact the driver to let them know not to go back to the restaurant that they had included the gravy on the egg foo young which even she found strange since she also was accustomed to receiving her gravy separately.
 Now I have a quart of rice with very little gravy. But I'd figured I'd make do. To begin with the egg foo young patties seems awfully small, but after all it's the taste that counts, right. Not only were they flavorless but the pork was dried out like it was a couple of days old. So I decided to try my Chinese barbecued ribs, at first sight I knew this was going to be a disaster, I could already see the bone of the rib and what little meat there was was so dry I had to take a swig of beer to wash it down. If this is their idea of new china cuisine please, please give me the old China, again the ribs were so dried out as if they were a few days old, hey folks, I know we're all going through  some tough times  right now and it's hard for many restaurants  to stay afloat but to treat your delivery customers this way, serving meat so dry that I would think twice before giving it to my dog is unacceptable especially when you're paying for it.

Egg Fu Young- their order comes with qty three large patties, and way more than enough gravy which is so very flavorful.  Can't beat their recipe! 

Mei Fun - Noodles are not over cooked, less on the veggie ingredients and more on the meat and noodles, you get a ton!  I like this version.

It's not like a normal Chinese Buffet where there are 8 buffet tables, with everything you can think of including sushi and pizza. They put a lot of thought and care into their small buffet, and I've never found another one like it. Somehow, even their simple vanilla ice cream is incredible. Sort of salty-sweet.

They get an extra star for delivery service, accepting debit card, and having their condiments put out so you can grab a handful, but that doesn't make up for their lackluster food. 

FOOD:

First off their rice is gross. I have had Uncle Ben's microwave rice that's tasted better than the crap I had. The sweet and sour shrimp was nothing but tasteless over battered shrimp. I stripped away most of the batter so I could actually taste the shrimp.

The crab rangoon I ordered was more cream cheese than anything. That's great that they really stuff it, but I want to taste the crab, in crab rangoon!!! Besides, I like a little more crunch to my rangoon.  

PRICE:

They're cheap. We had 2 small drinks, half order of beef lo mein, sweet and sour shrimp, and an order of crab rangoon for $18. 

APPEARANCE:

The inside is far from clean and orderly. There's napkins on the floor, the drink station is just stuffed with crap in a book shelf, and I'd hate to see the filth in the kitchen. 

SERVICE:

The guys answering the phones and at the front desk are friendly, I'll give them that. Cooks are slow with the food however. I would've already done had my food and eaten at Vin Hoa in the time we waited.

We've ordered from this place 4 or 5 times and so far they haven't run me off. Honestly, I am more into appetizers at these places than anything else but we have had some decent entrees.

It has been somewhat hit and miss for me but I will try to explain so that this is actually helpful.

Crab Rangoon - yes they are overfilled and sweet; I typically don't like this but for some reason these are okay 

Egg rolls - I've tried the pork and shrimp. I prefer the shrimp but the pork also have nice flavor. The egg rolls are better than most delivery places with chunky vegetables and a nice crisp wrapper.

Pot Stickers - These are not doughy and have good flavor alone. The sauce is also very good.

We've ordered fried rice, lo mein, General Tso's, Sweet and Sour Chicken and several others.

The Sweet and Sour is very good. Everything else, in my mind is OK.

I will say that I was between 3-4 stars but rounded up based on how friendly the staff was.  Maybe it was just rare that people dine in but I really felt welcomed and appreciated.

I had the General Tso chicken and the wife had the honey chicken.  Both were ordered as combo plates for about 8 bucks and came with an egg roll.  They brought that out as an appetizer before our entrees - nice touch.  The egg roll was roughly the temperature of the surface of the sun when delivered so I broke mine in half and went to get some sauces to try with it.  They have the typical carry-out packages of sauce but in more varieties and quantity than I think I've ever seen before.  I experimented a bit but settled on the spicy mustard because it just felt right.  Very good eggrolls!

You can dine in and sit there like I did but at the same time it's kind of awkward just because the owner's children are just there playing and messing around in front of you. Not sure if that's a regular occurrence here but when I was there that's what I experienced.

The food isn't too bad, nothing spectacular and I've definitely had better but at the same time it's not the worst. I got a small Hot and Sour Soup for $2.25, a small Chicken Fried Rice for $4.50 and an order of Kung Pao Chicken for $8.50. Everything was relatively good but I think the best thing was the soup since it had the right balance of being hot instead of just being sour like the way most places serve it.

Its close to my home and they deliver to my house (even right after a snow storm when I cant get out of my driveway), but mostly my husband goes to pick up our orders.
While it is true that 88 China has a protracted menu with over 100 different items the food I like here are the more Americanized dishes. While I am embarrassed to admit this-I actually like things like General Tsos Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Crab Rangoon (this makes me sound very sophisticated right?)  and 88 China does these dishes really well. My teenagers really like these menu items as well and they are both picky eaters.  (I continue to make myself sound very distinguished)
Every time I look at their menu I start out with the intention of trying something different & something on the Lite Chinese Food menu, but then I gravitate toward my old faithfuls.
If you like the greasy high fat Chinese food options I highly recommend this place for carry out or delivery but must warn you not to opt for dining in.  You will be sorry you did.  The place looks very run down, has zero ambiance, and probably could use a bucket of bleach and a scrub brush.
However, when I have a hankering for some gooey, greasy, spicy fried chicken balls or fried cream cheese there is nothing that will satisfy like the General Tso's Chicken with a side of Crab Rangoon.

My food was sooo greasy and unseasoned. My egg roll was greasy as well and it was filled with that disgusting red balls of so-called Roast Pork (tastes more like sweet and sour imitation bacon bits). My boyfriend's food was full of filler vegetables like carrots and onions. His broccoli were the size mini trees, so much stalk and his beef was extremely chewy (like my chicken). I am from the Northside of St. Louis and the Chinese food and that side of town is sooo much better. I figured being in West County and the great reviews that I would get a high quality of food than the Northside. Boy, was I wrong! Chop Suey Inn's entire menu has this place beat in food quality and service. At least in Chop Suey Inn, they have a space heater for the patrons waiting for their food.

Looking for new Chinese restaurant and on first try we liked it.  Ordered soup, appetizers, 2 entrees, & side of fried rice.  Large Won Ton soup had plenty of won tons.  Small sized entrees was plenty to share in our opinion.  

Only small issue was we ordered small appetizer and got a large.  I thought bill was off and didn't question when picking up.  Got home and saw where the issue.

We will try again.

Ordered ToGo Multiple times since original post and we are very happy with the food and service. Crab Rangoon's and the Won Ton Soup are excellent. When ordering large soup there are way more wontons than the broth can support. So when ordering large wonton soup we add an order of broth for add'l $2. I'm not a fan of the fried rice, but it's OK.

This afternoon, we ordered around 2 p.m., thinking delivery would be in about an hour. Didn't take that long. So, this was kinda like dunch.

We had two HUGE bags of food. Two of the dishes were mine, and they were stupendous:

House Special Fried Rice (I call it 10-ingredient fried rice.) -- A massive container filled with fried rice (but not really that much, because there was so much protein: large shrimp, chicken, pork, beef strips and maybe ham), white onion, green onion and carrots.

I was amazed about the amount of protein in a dish like this, and it made me happy. A delightful flavor-fest.

Garlic Chicken -- Another massive container. The dish contained (everything in pretty large pieces) broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots, white onion, huge amounts of chicken, green pepper and bamboo shoots in a rich, sesame seed brown sauce.

I did not taste a lot of garlic, but I really do like garlic, so could have used a bit more.

This dish was so well-balanced, and all the flavors held their own to stand out.

Orange chicken?  No problem!  
Pad Thai?  I can name four places.

My love for Korean food, and lack of places to get it, has driven me to start cooking more frequently.  It's always fun being a mid-twenties white guy walking into the Asian Market.  You get a few looks at first, but after seeing you week after week, people start to warm up to you.

Chong, the stores namesake, is so incredibly sweet and helpful.  Every time I walk in, she rushes over to greet me and asks me what I am going to be cooking this week.  She walk through the store with me as I shop to make sure I get everything I need to make the best curry or soup I intend on cooking.  She also loves to offer cooking tips to help those first-timers out.  Chong makes all of the Kimchi herself, which tastes delicious.

The prices in the store are the norm for most Asian stores.  Since its I pass it on my way home from work, I usually duck in to grab some Pocky or Koala Yummies (my favorite bite sized snack).

Complex review.  First time back in Belleville have lived here for four years, and then away for two, now on the opposite end of town that I used to.  Also, we're in the midst of Covid.
Neither of these things seemed to be an impediment in getting me the Chinese food I wanted.
Their menu was online, and they answered their phone nearly immediately.  I had no trouble placing my order.
The person told me 45 minutes (which is a little longer than I'd liked to have waited, but...) the order arrived nearly exactly 45 minutes later.  I really appreciate accurate wait times!  I don't like to be told 20 minutes if it's really gonna be 30...  So, I like that.
Anyway, we got MooShu Pork, Pork Egg Foo Young combo platter, and Sesame Chicken combo platter.  (the conbo platters came with fried rice (we opted for pork-fried-rice) and egg rolls.)
It arrived hot and was ALL delicious.  
Particularly delicious pork fried rice.
Really the only critique I have (in case the owner is reading) would be to include some cayenne pepper packets in the go bag... there was plenty of soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce packets, but no red pepper.  
All in all, excellent food and excellent service!

However tonight Friday, October 2 I ordered online at 5:37 and at 7:08 I got a refund saying that they haven't even started my food yet. At least I got my money back however I feel sorry for those many people who ordered tonight and did not get their food including those from DoorDash.   My recommendation is this, if you are swamped it is better to serve the people that have ordered rather than to take more orders and tell them an hour and a half for their dinner

The chicken was deep fried and not broasted which is common in the St. Louis area. Sauce had a ginger, sweet and spicy flavor with scallions which enhanced the flavor of the sauce. A winner in my book. 
The spring roll was sweet and moist. Egg drop soup seemed like it was home made because it wasn't very salty and the egg whites had a firm texture. 
The dinning area is small about 20 people so it is basically a carry out place. They have pictures of various dishes behind the counter which is very helpful.

They are a mixed blessing, promising exotic and familiar fare with no waiting, and a wide variety of dishes to pick and choose from.  Too often, the most that can be said is; ""Well, the food sucks, but there's lots of it.""  Not so at the Ginger Buffet.  This is one of the good ones.

For under ten bucks, they serve freshly made sushi -- made on the premises -- and while they have their share of the ubiquitous roll sushi, they also serve salmon nigiri, and yellowtail, and unagi.  Yep.  That's right.  For about ten bucks.  All you want.

They also have a Mongolian grill, allowing you to mix up your own little specialties and have them cooked for you.  And they don't scrimp either; you can have scallops and shrimp, as well as chilled snow crab legs and mussels.  Often its the seafood that gets the heave-ho first as cost savings go into effect.  Not here.

The tea is meh.  There.  I said it.  It's that urn-made oolong-ish brew that is warm and wet and lacks any other defining characteristic.

The bulk of the cooking here is okay; above average, but not show-stopping.  Here, it's the little things that more than make up for it.  Lychees on the dessert table; really decent salads.  They have a mixed Caesar salad here loaded with garlic and shredded Parmesan.  Yow.  Not Chinese, sure.  But really good for you.

We were hungry and traveling with a group so we were looking for a buffet to take the kids.  We found this place and walked inside and were seated.  No one was rude, but the service could have been way better.  The drinks were just placed at the table and left for us to disperse among ourselves.  While we were eating the waitress just plopped down all of our checks in the middle of the table without a word.  
On the way home I realized that my daughter had left her purse there.  Keep in mind that we are 6 hours from Ginger Buffet.  So I called them around 9 pm, hoping that they had her purse.  The person I talked to, said that they did have it.  I gleefully thanked him and asked if they could mail it to me and I would gladly pay for shipping.  He informed me that they could not mail it, that I needed to come back and pick it up.  I was taken back.  Thinking that he didn't understand me, I reinstated I LIVED 6 hours away that I could not just drive to pick it up, I would gladly pay shipping if they could mail it back to me.  He still refused and said that I needed to get a friend or a relative to come by and pick it up.  I then asked for the manager.  He told me she was not there, that I could call back in the morning.  After getting her name, I hung up very upset that my daughter would never see her purse again.  After talking it over with my husband, we remembered we had a friend that lived a couple of hours from this place.  We called him and miraculously he was going to be going through there on Tuesday (this was Saturday).  He said he would stop and pick it up.  So, with renewed hope, I called Ginger again and told the guy that I had a friend who would be coming through and pick it up on Tuesday.  His response ""Tuesday?, can it be sooner?""  Oh my God!!!!  I told him that this person lives 2 hours away and this was the only time he could come retrieve the purse.  The guy told me to call and remind them about the purse to make sure they still had it.????  It is Monday and tomorrow is the day my friend will be going by to pick up the purse.  I called yesterday and asked to speak to the manager, the same guy told me that they still had the purse and he would relay the message to the manager.

I always make a beeline for the Mongolian grill and pile up my plate with all the seafood offerings.  There's usually a line of 1-2 people waiting to get their food cooked, so after I tell the chef my choice of sauce, I usually grab a bowl of soup (the hot and sour is excellent) and drop it off at my table.  There's a tip jar sitting next to the grill, and I don't mind paying a little extra, since I usually go for the lunch buffet, which I believe is about $7-8.  You get a lot of food for that!  

Most of the prepared dishes are pretty good; I especially like the peanut butter chicken, even though I know there's nothing remotely Chinese about it.  They always have a good selection of fresh fruit and the little sugar-covered donuts are MAGICAL.

There is another Asian restaurant next door but we are glad we stuck to the great reviews about this place. 

It's a very large and spacious dining room and there were only 6 other people there when we arrived. That's unfortunate considering what good food they had! We ordered the crab Rangoon, vegetable egg roll, vegetable Lo mein and the traditional Chinese style Kung pao chicken (from the Chinese menu) and it was all very delicious.  The Lo mein wasn't too oily and it was full of flavor.  The Kung pao chicken was fresh, flavorful and fantastic according to my husband.  It had just the right amount of spiciness. Both entrees were pretty large portions so be aware of that when ordering from the dinner menu.  Our bill came to just under $30 with one added drink. Would have been cheaper with no appetizers and water but it was all worth it! The waiter was friendly and the service was good.  The bathrooms were extremely clean.

Our server/owner maybe?  He was very attentive and on the ball.  This guy couldn't stay busier.  As soon as he was finished tending to his tables, he'd go off in some other section of the restaurant and sweep or wipe something down.  I'm not a health nut, but I do try to make better choices now and then and they have a ""weight watchers"" section in the menu.  I'm not sure if they understand the actual company or weight loss system of ""Weight Watchers,"" but it is lower calorie/fat selections.  I think they call the selections that because they are for those who are watching their weight.  Basically these items are non fried, sauce on the side dishes.

I have been on a quest for true Orange Chicken for awhile now. Most lesser Oriental restaurants don't serve the real deal. They will usually do one of two things: Take General Tso's chicken and take out the chile-peppers/heat and call it Orange Chicken OR they will serve you the same chicken and sauce in Sweet and Sour Chicken with a few less vegetables (or none at all) and call that Orange Chicken, too. Ever wonder why Orange Chicken never tastes like...orange? 

We went to Shangri La, a place we frequent, but oddly - I've never ordered Orange Chicken there. This time I did and - warning! - if you eat their Orange chicken you can never go back to faux versions! 

Candied/fried shavings of real orange peel in the sauce which was THICK with real honey over perfectly breaded and firm white meat chicken. The sauce is incredible. Does it taste like orange? Absolutely!

I moved here from MKE, which shouldn't have better sushi than STL since both are Midwest... But overall the STL sushi scene is horribly disappointing, until I found this place. I absolutely love sushi & had given up on it here (STL area) - it is just that bad. I had tried the highly raved Drunken Fish, Wasabi, Seven, & other STL sushi restaurants & was always horribly disappointed by their low quality fish & extremely high prices. 
This place is not the high quality fish (I get sashimi everywhere) that you'll get in any other U.S. City (Seattle, Chicago, NYC, LA, San Diego, etc - I travel a lot for work...) - but it is the highest quality I've had in the STL area & the prices are good for the area too. (I also find STL to be horribly overpriced for sushi compared to the rest of the country.) 
So overall, STL does suck for good sushi (sorry, but have to honest) - but this place is definitely the best & will be the only place I go for my sushi fix when in the STL area.

Avocado salad: creamy and balanced, not too sweet.

I wish I could talk about their menu in full, but the first time I ate from here I got the mushroom chicken and haven't been tempted to try anything else. I go with the fried rice with decent chunks of chicken giant pieces of halved button mushrooms, crunchy snap peas, carrots, and water chestnuts. All of this is served with soy sauce. My only complaint is the rice is sometimes a bit overcooked/dry but I can over look that. Possibly the real reason I keep coming back is the crab rangoon. With your order you get the choice of a side of crab rangoon or egg rolls. There is nothing unique about the crab rangoon, they just serve it with that golden brown crunchy exterior, and the sweet creamy crab filling you expect. For me they are kinda addictive.

There are 3 ways to get your dose of New China: Dine-In, Delivery, or Take Out. I've never dined in, small dining area with one large table that could probably seat 6, delivery in my experiences has been very slow, so I recommend take out.

The Gyoza is top notch!! We always get it fried and they do a great job with cooking it and it's filled with a delicious meat mixture. The Crab Rangoon is also good, not the best I've had as I don't like it so sweet but it's not overly sweet like some. 
The first time I came I got sushi which was good but this time I got miso soup and and Shrimp Teriyaki. I was pleasantly surprised with the freshness of the cooked veggies and shrimp and the sauce was not the gnawing teriyaki blend that too many use. The miso soup is packed with tofu, seaweed, and flavor. 
We got 2 lunch sushi combos and the goal lived it and it was a great deal for the price as well. They also shared a lunch beef noodle bowl. It was delicious, packed with veggies and meat, and a huge portion.

I went with the Red Curry with chicken and she got Pad Roum Mit with chicken. The sauce was great on both, chicken and vegetables good too. Spiciness can be specified on 0-5 scale and you can use spices to add more at your table if you want. Spice rack includes crushed red pepper, somewhat sweet chili paste, and crushed peanuts. Red Curry was already about a 2 they said so I left it there and tried adding things here and there and it was just as hot as I'd want. Wife's Pad Roum Mit she got at a 3 and added more also.

Read the reviews: good food + bad service. We wanted take out so bad service, no big deal. 
They got our order right & it was ready at the time they told us it would be. 
I absolutely love spring rolls - but these... The rice paper was slightly dried out & starting to tear & all that was inside them was lettuce, a tiny bit of shredded carrots, & a mint leaf. Severely lacking. All the food was severely lacking. 
The pot stickers tasted like something you find in the frozen food aisle. The tom yum wasn't flavorful & I didn't see any fresh herbs except a couple very wilted cilantro leaves & the shrimp in it were not fresh to the point I didn't eat them for fear of them making me sick (they looked good, but when I bit into one, it was extremely mushing). 
My husbands curry was ok (he said) but nothing that was good enough for him to want more of.

It was later in the lunch hour--1:30 or so, and there weren't too many people there. It took some time for anyone to give us menus or take our drink orders. While we perused the menu, we saw three tables who'd been there when we got there finally get their food; all three immediately boxed it and left. They were clearly people there on their lunch hour who had to go and had been waiting way too long. We waited for some time for our food too, and our daughter's meal came well after ours, which is a little backwards...she's only 2, so I'd have preferred to wait to get my food until all was ready, as toddlers don't understand ""it's coming!"" The food was good, but mine was cold. The server was pretty unapologetic for his lack of attention and was quick to tell us how busy they've been and how understaffed...that may well be the case, and as someone who's waited tables, I totally feel his pain, but we were there when it was no longer busy and it didn't seem to affect things. 

Not long after this, my husband ordered carryout from Zapp. They told him 45 minutes. He went after 45 minutes and they hadn't even started cooking it yet. For this place to survive, they're going to have to step it up a lot.

I ordered the pad-see-ew lunch special. It came with crab rangoon, which is not bad. It also came with tum yum soup which tasted nothing like tum yum and only had some tofu cubes. On top of that, it was super salty! I like salty and heavily flavored food, but this was like someone accidentally dumped a bottle of salt in there. When I told the waiter, he said he would tell the kitchen. But no follow up or apology after that. Then onto the pad-see-ew. Soupy with tons of soy sauce. They also used broccoli instead of Asian broccoli (which is usually the ingredient). The flavor is just not right. I ordered the noodle with pork, which was chewy, chunky, and tasteless. Then I paid extra $1 for the fried rice. Well, that was actually quite bland!  So when I put the fried rice in the soupy sauce in the noodle, we got somewhere. Overall, I have to say that it was the worst thai food I have ever had. Perhaps the other items on the menu are good, but not what I ordered.

I went on a date night with my girlfriend a few days ago and I ordered the General's Chicken (I know, it's Chinese). The breaded chicken had obviously been frozen. When I mentioned this to our server, I was told that's indeed the case. I'm almost positive that the sauce is the bagged, brown sauce available at Trader Joe's. The chicken was never tossed in the sauce, instead the sauce was poured on, leaving huge potions of over-fried, dry chicken. Also, rather than having pepper flakes incorporated into the 'sauce' some 'chef' just shook cayenne pepper all over the plate. I can eat some serious heat, but they used so much that it was utterly and completely inedible. I took three bites and refused to pay. I can't imagine eating making a meal that atrocious in my own home, let alone paying for it at a restaurant. Our waiter even admitted that it seemed 'they didn't put too much effort into my meal.' I'll say! It also came out in less than 5 minutes. I guess that's how long it takes to deep fry some frozen chicken and nuke a bag of sauce in the microwave. Gordon Ramsey, help!!!

As we were driving away, my girlfriend joked that its too bad we didn't just go to Mickey D's and blow the extra cash on beer. Minutes too late but her head's in the right place. I should mention she's Thai.

Value - if you are going to charge Shangri-la prices, please serve food comparable to theirs. Otherwise, you need to take it down a few notches. $31 for 2 people was not a good price for what we received.

I can say that the Thai food was good to me, very unique spicy sweet flavors.  I probably gave an extra star, as the food did not WOW me.  Well some of it did and some didn't. 

The heavenly beef was great on my tongue.   It was salty, sweet and beefy like I like it.  Never had beef like that before.  Heavenly Beef, was heavenly it tasted like a cross between beefy beef and sweet milky honey to me.

The post stickers were good also with the sauce they give you, which by the way are two kinds. 1 was a sweet and sour spicey type the other was a soy sauce with some sweetness to it, both dipping sauces were very good.  I am not sure how the pot stickers were supposed to taste but they were good.

I had shrimp dumplings,  those were just okay.  As I love seafood and could not get a shrimpy taste on it as I like.  The shrimp tasted like they may not have been fresh, perhaps frozen?

The crab rangoon was okay,  I have had Chinese food better than the crab rangoon.

For my main entree it was a seafood curry.  Not the best but the curry sauce was enjoyable.   It was a coconut,  spicey sweet sauce that was delicious to me.  However, they left some tail on the shrimp and some had it off.  I am thinking they were supposed to take the tails off?

I told myself that I would avoid one star ratings to be fair with businesses during this pandemic.   I came across a situation with this establishment that prevents me from committing to my words.  Allow me to explain!  

I have been fan of Panda Express for years and all the ones I have dined in or carry out have been exceptional until the O Fallon, IL highway 50 experience.  I normally eat at the mall location but weather was horrible so decided to do the drive window.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!  Let me say that again.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!!!  I get up to the order box and said hello-anticipating a pleasant reply but, instead,  was told to wait.  No hello or ""how are you"" or ""nature is calling, be right back"" or anything.  Just a straight ""busy hold on"".  Thats should have been the moment I drive off.  Red flag was shooting up in my head but I refused to adhere to the warning.  So I waited.  She finally came back and ask what I want.  I proceeded with first of two orders.  I wanted the plate but before I could finish the word, she immediately interrupted with ""RICE or NOODLES"".  Now mind you that when someone frequents Panda Express and know how to order, she or he would order with no pause or break in words.  A smooth simple fluent steady words flowing to the end of the order.  I good customer service provider would know to allow the client to finish.  Just sayin!  But, no!  Her interest was to treat me rudely.  Unpleasant tone of voice and no polite kind words with every statement that came out of her mouth.  This sort of reminds me what it was like in the military during chow out in the field serving hundreds of soldiers in line.  Just move along people!

Anyway!  Where was I?  Oh, yes! So, I go said noodles and, again, she immediately ask for meat item  before I could finish.  Okay!  At this point I was getting annoyed so I ask her to please slow it down and allow me to order as I have ordered from Panda Express before and know what I want.  She then paused to reply!  I looked behind me and see no other cars so I don't think she needs to be in such a hurry.  She came back and with no remorse or apology, she just said ""next order"".  Now the battle is on!!!!  I then asked to speak to the manager.  She just went on asking for my order.  I could tell she was angry as I could see her through the glass window of the restaurant standing at the buffet bar.  So, I just told her to slow it down in taking the order and give customers time to finish speaking.  She then said ""I don't need to take this"".  I saw that she saw me as I was seeing her drop the service spoon and just walk away.  I just drove off.  

I have to say that we all are human and emotions will take over on occasion.  But, when you are clocked in to work and representing a company, then it is your obligation to be professional and represent.  It is the company obligation to train employees customer service.",68583,Panda Express,1504 W U.S. 50,O'Fallon,IL,62269,38.592413,-89.948247,2.5,54,1,"Chinese, Fast Food, Restaurants","{'Monday': '10:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '10:0-22:0', 'Friday': '10:0-22:30', 'Saturday': '10:0-22:30', 'Sunday': '10:0-22:0'}",True,True,,False,2,True,True,u'none',True,True,True,u'average','casual',True,u'free',True,,,False,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,10:0-22:0,10:0-22:0,10:0-22:0,10:0-22:0,10:0-22:30,10:0-22:30,10:0-22:0

But fear not, we realized there was a new building-strip that was built recently behind Buffalo Wild Wings, and we knew in our hearts that Oriental Spoon must be located there.

Once we arrived for lunch, we were pleasantly delighted to be there. The lighting and color of the restaurant was nice, and I'd imagine in the spring/summer it'll be even better (windows along one side of the restaurant).

My friend noticed the Jajamen (Black bean noodle pasta) on the menu and became immediately excited. She had had this dish in China and was excited to see how it stood up to one of her favorite asian dishes. I on the other hand went with some typical Korean food of  Bul Go Gi (Korean BBQ-ish).

This is a very well decorated fast food Korean place. The music played was great and we really liked the atmosphere. 
The waiter forgot some of our meal and the food came out all at different times. 

Although the atmosphere held promise, we were not fans of the food.  I had hoped to find some healthy options on the menu and could not. The vegetables in the rice were canned/frozen. The only non-fried rice was the curry. I thought the curry was decent.  Disappointingly, the spring rolls were fried, which may be a regional way to cook spring rolls, but I sure wish the menu said as much.

But I always tend to gravitate to JaJangmyeon  or the jajangbap-- which is with the same sauce except with rice instead of noodles. Maybe I am biased because I do love jajangmyeon in general, but my taste buds do not lie--and I have tried jajangmyeon at many places during my lifetime of 22 years. Oriental Spoon is ranked among my top 3 of jajangmyeon and best of all I don't have to drive 5hrs to Chicago for it!!!  
Last Friday night went to oriental spoon with my sister and a friend(non-Korean) to show her a taste of "" my people's"" food. The non-Korean  ordered korean curry rice, my sister ordered hot and spicy Korean chicken and of course I went with jajangbap. My jajangbap was delicious like always. My friend enjoyed the curry, but loved the jajangbap-- as well as my sister because she stole the last bite of my dinner! My sister and friend enjoyed the chicken, while I found it to be spicy,but my tolerance for spicy food is low( it's sad and yes, I'm Korean!) 
Because I am Korean I know what all menu items are, but with people who are unfamiliar with Korean crusine the menu may be confusing- it lacks pictures, but the wait staff make up for it because they are excellent about talking you thru the menu items. So don't be afriad to ask!  
If you're looking for your regular Americanized Chinese food-- go else where because Oriental Spoon serves KOREAN cruisine with a little flare.

As a Korean-American living in Southern IL, I know that Korean food in is pretty scarce in this area... actually nonexistent. But Oriental Spoon, although it sounds like the food will be that of ""China King"" or ""China HIng"", serves authentic Korean food.

Now for the experienced Korean food diners, don't expect it to be a full blown Korean restaurant with all the side-dishes. Because it is situated in Southwestern IL I think that the restaurant allows diners to experience Korean food without over-exposing them to what might be a little weird. So I'm pretty understanding to that fact.

The food has been consistent. I've only tried their jajamyeon and their spicy chicken. According to others I've dined with the chicken was spicy but I thought it was fine. i think that the jajamyeon is a good first Korean dish to try because it is a Korean/Chinese dish. So for first timers it won't be too ""different"". And for those who are a little more adventurous I would recommend ordering the Kimchee (less than $3 can't remember the price off the top of my head) along with the entree.

Also, my most recent visit got me thinking... This place deserves a 5-star bump.

First of all, even though it has been a long time since my last visit and review, I realized that my taste hasn't changed at all. I still ordered the gim rolls and jap chae during my visit this week.  I've been thinking about driving here and since I had some other business to tend to around the area, I purposely drove here at lunch time and made sure I was hungry. 

I was a little scared that through the years, something might have changed but no! Still the same delicious flavors I have come to know and love. Granted, this is really more of a Korean fusion place (no ban chan here) but the menu items they do offer are wholesome and worth the 40-minute drive.

My gim rolls and jap chae were delicious as ever! I think out of all the places I've had jap chae from, this has got to be my favorite.

I was in dire need of a Korean food fix, so I found Oriental Spoon just in time. 

The restaurant itself is a small but cozy and contemporary looking place. The hostess/waittress is friendly and I'm guessing a relative or family member of the restaurant owners. It is definitely not anything like the Korean tofu houses that I am used to going to, but still very nice. They also have a bar area where you can eat and order drinks. 

It had been a cold and rainy day when we went for dinner so I was really hoping to get some soon dubu (Korean tofu soup). Unfortunately, the waittress told me that they did not serve that type of soup there. Bummer. However, they completely made up for it with their Gal Bi. It's one of the pricier items on the dinner menu, but completely and utterly worth it! I prefer Gal Bi (marinated short rib) over Bulgogi and Oriental Spoon did not disappoint. I was brought a very nice portion of Gal Bi along with some rice and some egg drop soup to start. The meat was marinated perfectly and cooked so tender. I finished off each piece down to the bone like it was my last meal on Earth! 

There are only a few things that I would add to the menu that would make this a 5-star restaurant for me. First, I would include the ""bancha"" with each meal, which are little appetizers that are served at the beginning. The bancha usually includes some kimchi, pickled cucumber, noodles, potato salad and a couple other side dishes. Second, I would definitely put soondubu (tofu soup) on the menu. It is cooked and then placed in a steaming hot clay pot. When it is brought out to you, you crack an egg into it and you mix it while it cooks in the soup. It is simply delicious! Third, I would add the mung bean pancakes. This is a great appetizer to share with people and can be made with just vegetables or sometimes even seafood. The addition of these things would make their menu complete in my book.

I'm ecstatic to have found Oriental Spoon. This is a place that more people need to come and try. I love ethnic foods and I hope that Oriental Spoon continues to expand their menu and grow as a restaurant.

I asked if I could get some chicken added to the veggie fried rice and he told me no and didnt bother to ask anyone.  Really are you kidding me?  You can add shrimp but not chicken? I thought the prices were a tad on the high side for the very small container.  I can get great quality food and good portions for a good price at Wang Gang across town.  I ordered food left and came back to pick it up.  One of the owners was very kind and answered my questons a little better than their staff and offered me a drink while I waited.  I thought this was very nice of them.  He also explained how I could get tofu or chicken added to my rice.  From the take out menu I didnt even think they had chicken anything on the menu.  The owner showed me an in house menu that had chicken plain as day on it!  So the staff needs to work up on their knowledge.  I think all in all it's the language barrier between young taff & owners & cooks.  Nice lil place, good wood floors, music, and chairs with patio.  Over all nice decor with an odd open floor plan.  But for the price and portions and lack of knowledge I don't see myself going back.  I hate to do this to the owners since they seemed very nice.

The Food 

 I liked the Mushroom Bulgogi very much - wonderfully prepared - especially after having some beef added to the dish. 

Crab Ragoon - Cold in the center, and shaped like a large egg roll - 3/10

Gim Roll - scalding hot in the middle... I cannot begin to describe to you how unbelievably uncomfortable the first bite was. Someone left it in the deep fryer a long long time. 





The rest of the experience was far below average.

Cold ""Chilly"" inside the restaurant - It was like someone turning the heater on in your cold garage, and having you sit down in a chair while you waited for the entire cold soaked  garage to warm up

When I sit down in a restaurant at 5:30 PM, and the radiant cold permeates the wall and other surfaces around me - I wonder why restaurants continue to shut off their heat overnight and nickel and dime their business operation.

I would say this restaurant is run with a little bit of a nickel and dime, shoestring budget. One of the first things a person came in asking, I think it's a server, ""what are we out of today?""


Service: HORRIBLE 

My server was new, and informed me I was required to show my ID before she could serve me beer. Really?  I'm  a 60+ year old man... you're kidding right?

I'm sure this comes from management, and it just shows a lack of common sense and weak business practice of management/ownership. Let's insult the customer before they begin their meal. So I subordinate myself, reach for my wallet pull out my drivers license why this young inexperienced server tries to find my birthdate. What a joke.

I asked for a beverage menu, so I could review the cocktail selection... There is no cocktail menu printed, because they don't offer one. ""OK thank you may I have a beer and wine menu please?""

Response: ""we don't have one""

You see, they have to check and determine which beers available because they get so many different beers in all the time. None of the beers are offered in writing they just tell you verbally, same with the wine. The two beers I ordered were not available... But then I was told an ""international"" Chinese beer was available, So I happily selected this, and requested a cold bottle. When I requested a second bottle during my meal, I was told it was warm, and it's the last one left. I asked about a glass of wine, but there is no wine menu...I asked about what they have for white wine and I was told by the waitress they have only Merlot and one bottle of opened Cabernet. But be aware, this is after multiple trips to chase beer, and get information on wine from someone else.

By now I'm annoyed.


If I ever came here again, it would only be to pick up a take-out order. Would never select dine in service again... And since both my appetizers were horrible... Would probably just stick to a basic basic dish or two.


Thought 

They don't understand how to run a restaurant. 

It's not a relaxing, comfortable experience for the guest. 

Incompetency starts at the top, I'm pretty sure of that. It's not hard to have an inventory of beverages, and print off a menu o the customer can make an informed selection. We shouldn't have to make a game of it..

They simply don't have their act together, and I couldn't  endure another blank stare from the waitress - who doesn't have any idea what she's doing. When you don't know what you're doing... Start by cleaning dirty dishes at the table, and refilling the water glass shall we?

Take out only... That's the only way I would ever return.

Their fried wontons are fantastic, crispy and very inexpensive too. They serve it with sweet and sour sauce like you get on the chicken. Their fried dumplings are the best I ever had. The inside is juicy and the wrap is a little thicker than most places serve. They taste homemade. My husband tried the wonton egg drop soup tonite and it was very flavorful. I was thinking a pint would be as big as a little sauce container but it was easily 2 servings.

I love the beef and broccoli. Its very heavy on the beef and so I always ask for extra broccoli. My husband likes the sweet and sour pork and also the pork and mushrooms. Again, I usually get 2 servings out of the container. You won't think so when you see it but as you take it out and put it on a plate, it multiplies! And rice reheats well if you steam it the next day. 5 minutes and its light and fluffy again.

Lastly, even though some things are not on the combination plate menu, they will make anything a combination and you can substitute lo mein noodles for the fried rice.

They deliver locally but we usually call it in and just pick it up.

Bamboo Valley is really generic Asian Buffet meal, cheap and subpar food. They have a Mongolian BBQ as well that looked questionable too. The ""sushi"" here was the cheap cut and slap together kind that is seaweed paper, rice, and fish toppings that seems just barely bordering on the passable. If anything this place doesn't deserve a ""Grade 'A' food"" rating needs to be revoked and given a B or C instead. 

The customers were moderately noisy and seemed like the local divey for late lunch crowd. Several parents and their children clustered for a group meal at one of the larger tables.

The food was less than stellar....I can think of many adjectives to describe it but let's go with disgusting and greasy. But the main reason I'm taking time out of my day is to let you know they completely disregarded the city wide BOIL ORDER. Maybe it was the lack of or inability to communicate (English) or maybe they just didn't care. Unfortunately I was unaware of the boil order and was pounding my liquids and now thinking about it they seemed awfully push for my refilled drinks. As I was leaving I saw a sign warning patrons of the boil order (had been placed on the door while I was eating) but yet they continued to serve. I can only assume I will be passing away soon due to the bacteria infections I have.

There are several good dishes and there are some to avoid. I am an octopus salad fan and it's good here. Sushi is hit or miss, but that's true of everywhere  that is not an actual professional sushi place. They have hibachi...looks okay, just have not done it yet, maybe next time.

I should start that I went for a late lunch at the recommendation of another yelper.  I ordered the lunch special which was served until 3pm (nice) I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with drunken noodles.  I ordered them moderately hot, I forget their scale.  I give them HUGE Kudos for serving the food spicy.  It has been my experience on the IL side that a lot, (no check that ALL) of Thai restaurants will not serve you spicy food for fear of you sending it back.  This entrée was incredible.  The veggies were fresh and it was very flavorful.  The only comment that I would have is that the price of $8 it either needs to be cheaper or a larger portion.  Other reviewers have commented on this as well.

The special came with a chicken and rice soup.  The broth was flavorful as Asian soups tend to be.  The chicken and rice tasted like it was out of a Campbells can.  A real let down after the broth.  There were some crunchy veggies in there as a pleasant surprise.  But it was not really all that all things concerned.  

There was also some kind of fried roll.  It was not very flavorful and it broke during cooking so it collected a lot of grease.  I do not hold this against the restaurant.  That can happen anywhere.

So being that my boyfriend and I had just moved into the local area that week, we were in search of a great place to go for Thai. The reviews I read before going here was what made me skip all others to go straight here. Spot on reviews. 

While we were the first ones in on a Sunday at noon, that did not last for long because groups of people and couples started to show up right after us. I guess this is the place to go on a Sunday after church. 

We had very attentive servers and received great food. My boyfriend saw the special on the wall across from us, it happened to be grouper and your choice of sauce for $8.99. Now we just moved here from Destin, FL and that is the Grouper city. You can never find a grouper dish like that for that great of a price. So of course he went with that, otherwise he was going the route of the red curry.

I had gotten the Pad Thai because I like to see how each Pad Thai is done at any thai place. It was delicious, I went home with leftovers for lunch the next day and was happy as could be. One thing I wish, is that their drinks and appetizers were a little lower priced or I would have had something other then water.

I was also happy to find that they deliver (but I doubt to Shiloh) and they update their specials on Facebook and their website.

Indeed our visit, while drawn out quite a bit, was very good and we will return.  They dealt by calling in cute cousins (from the gym it seems...but who cares with food this good).  I don't think they anticipated a big party table and stream of folks all at once..it happens and they adapted.

Started with spring rolls, crisp, hot, delicious, filled with vegetable and shrimp bits. The sauce was a very good flavor boost, not that neon stuff on buffet set ups. I got a Trang beer, not really that unique after-all but I wanted to try a Thai beer and $5 is less than a ticket.  My wife got a bit of a stingy pour of Zinfandel (a bit later in the meal than planned, after the gym reinforcements arrived). I would stick to the food and forgo alcohol here overall, there are better deals.

My wife had a dish called ""Golden Pillow"" a lovely looking plate with interesting crisp noodles, vegetables and shrimp in a unique brown sauce.  She really liked how the texture was mixed by softer noodles that had hit the sauce versus the crunch of the other.  I tasted the sauce, it was a little sweet and  elegantly seasoned.

I got a Red Curry with beef. It was excellent, the heat (I ordered ""hot"", 2 notches down from Thai hot...smart move) was just right. It was enough to open the nose, bring  a sheen of sweat to the head and make you consider the next morning...that coconut milk back note is excellent counterpoint.  I at first felt the dish could have used a couple more pieces of meat, I'm a wolf...but overall I think they know exactly what they are doing, I was satisfied by the end of the dish.

There was a super cute little girl (not sure if a daughter, granddaughter or ""cousin in training"" to be called in from the gym later some day)...but she had interesting short stories (five word long, Hemingwayesque, stories)...her job is to deliver straws to the tables and distract you from the hunger pangs.

Today the server had to be inexperienced. 4 people for lunch and she actually thought we order 6 full orders of spring rolls, plus the one that came with the lunch special. That would be 28 spring rolls that came to our table! She asked no questions and confirmed nothing when we ordered. Later she took along time explain why she made the mistake, essentially not her paying attention. My Tom Yum noodle soup at 3 stars heat, was almost clear and missing most of the ingredients listed.

I went to Mr. Chiu's on a local friend's recommendation.  I was a bit hesitant to drive all the way to Columbia, IL for Chinese, but I refused to go to my old stand-by Chinese restaurant (Old St. Louis Chop Suey - Chippewa/Kingshighway) due to stale ingredients.  If you're curious, I plan to share my thoughts on my Yelp review of that restaurant.  But I digress...

Anyway, so I was desperate for GOOD, FRESH Chinese food.  I was quite impressed with Mr. Chiu's.  Here is what I ordered:

Crab Rangoon:
Dough was fresh!  Filling was good, but could have used more.  I wish they offered more than six in an order.

Egg Rolls:
Perfect size, fresh ingredients inside.  The cabbage was fresher than any others I have tasted before.

Pepper Steak:
The green bell peppers were fresh and nicely sized.  Sometimes restaurants are in a hurry and leave the pieces too large for human consumption.  Onions could have been chopped smaller though.

Pork Fried Rice:
Holy Cow!  This is the BEST fried rice I have ever had.  The rice, bean sprouts, pork all seemed tops.  

Bonus Points:
I was surprised to see a small rice container of sweet n' sour sauce provided, as well as hot mustard.  I also was given many packets of sweet n' sour sauce upon my request, as well as hot red pepper.  AND the packets were clean packets; I hate when it looks like the restaurant has recycled the packets from a previous patron that left them at the table.",99716,Mr Chiu Restaurant,1260 Columbia Ctr,Columbia,IL,62236,38.4456125,-90.2200698,3.0,7,0,"Chinese, Restaurants",,True,,,,1,False,True,,,,False,,u'casual',,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,

I ordered an egg roll and Mongolian beef, and my husband order General Tso's chicken. On the plus side, the ingredients seemed fresh, the waitress was attentive and the water was nice and cold even with no ice which is how I prefer it. The decor was less cluttered and more clean looking than most shopping center Chinese restaurants.
As to the flavor of the food itself, it tasted like my first attempts at cooking Chinese food following recipes out of a Betty Crocker cookbook 20 years ago. The only flavoring seemed to be soy sauce. The crispy rice noodles were completely soggy underneath the meat and sauce, and the scallions were raw 2 inch long pieces on top like an unedible garnish. If they had just been the green top pieces, it would have been fine, but they included several pieces of the half inch diameter white part too which are too strong raw. They did take them back and cook them for me though which helped. The egg roll was edible, nuff said... My husband was not impressed with his meal either. I think next time we are in the mood for Chinese, we will stay home and heat up a bag of Aldi's frozen orange chicken which was as good or better than the General Tso's he ordered, or we will go to Thai House.

Let's first talk about their Crab Rangoon. OMG! I hate to admit it, but I've been known to just ordering it as an afterwork snack. Yes, it's your typical fast-food Crab Rangoon made with imitation crab, but they do it right. If size matters to you, theirs are huge and filled with a creamy center. Best of all, is how they wrap it up to-go. Instead of the little wax paper bags, they use a foil/paper bag that I remember carry-out fried chicken being put in as a child. Having this type of bag, keeps them good and warm during the drive home. 
I also like their egg rolls and for an entree, my go to is Beef and Broccoli. 

Their set up for touch-less pick-up is engienous. There's a separate sliding drawer/compartment for payment and then a huge box area with doors for grabbing your bags of food. You're totally protected by acrylic panels and glass. They also, use better carry-out vessels. 

The only detail that keeps them from getting that 5 Star rating is the customer service. As others have stated, at times it can be rude. I think that is because they are so busy and are rushing to complete all the orders in an orderly fashion.

Favorites/Highlights
General Tzos Chicken - my all time favorite, way crispier than any I have had anywhere and amazing sweet sauce

Sweet and Sour Chicken with pineapple (put in bowl, cover with sauce, let is soak for a few, and enjoy)

Cashew Chicken

pan wonton (are these pot stickers not sure)

They do rotate some things on here, but I tend to stay away from the seafood and dishes labeled spicy. The lo mien, fried rice, and crab rangoon are phenomenal accompaniments.

You call your order in advance, then when you arrive you call again to let them know you've arrived. When I arrived, the young lady running orders out was already making deliveries to other patrons and just stopped by car to ask which order was mine. When she returned with my order, she used the passenger side, so we did not have to touch each other passing the bag of food. The lady was friendly, detailed and was hustling to take care of all the cars waiting for carry-out. 

Being new to the neighborhood, this was my first visit. I ordered, an Egg Roll, Crab Rangoon and General Chicken with Fried Rice. I was not impressed by any of the items. My Egg Roll was over cooked. The pockets on the Crab Rangoon's were small and contained a very small portion of crab. My entree, General Chicken was very dry and was more breading then chicken. The Fried Rice was, just nasty.

Our chef dropped the pepper shaker one the floor and then proceeded to use it on our food!!! His skill at the grill was mediocre at best.

I did not come to be entertained by people flipping spatulas and throwing balls of rice at my face, but rather a nice sit down dinner with my partner.

Beer selection was poor- however they did have ""imports"" from far off lands like... Sam Adams and Fat Tire? hmmm.....

Cocktail list is ridiculous, and very little seemed to have much genuine Asian influence. The  list was all over the place- ranging from drinks called ""Zombie"" and ""Godzilla"" and a saki sangria, all of which were loaded to the brim with sugar, and things like French and Dirty Martinis. Since I don't enjoy drinking Willy Wonka cocktails and I didn't want to get hammered on martinis, I figured that something as simple as requesting an old fashioned was reasonable. what I received was a Tullamore Dew, water, and muddled fruit. Not disgusting, but definitely not an old fashioned. 

The appetizers we ordered were the stuffed mushrooms and a tuna roll, which ended up being the best part of the experience.

Now the entrees....
I came to dinner tonight in desperate need of a good steak- and on their menu I see a filet mignon! Pricey, yes, but I've paid more for steak. I put in my order and have to tell the server I wanted it rare, which I thought was weird that she didn't ask. As the night progressed my partner noticed how strange it is they didn't give us knives. I thought nothing of it, assuming I would receive one upon my plate reaching the table. And then it came... a chopped up pathetic pile of beef sitting next to an unexpected amount of sautéed veggies and fried rice. At this point my heart sinks- I am not 12, I don't want my food cut up for me. When I order a $27 filet mignon I expect a thick, full, red, tender delicious piece of paradise. Instead it was thin, barely pink, and chewy.

I know that this is a dinner and a show kinda restaurant, and probably would've been better to have just ordered sushi, but when you advertise a nearly $30 steak I expect to get a $30 cut of meat. My partner ordered the udon noodles with beef. It tasted like it was cooked in orange soda, and was inedibly sweet. She could not finish it.

The last straw? the bill was $90.

I would love to give this place 5 stars but the location/store looks very rough inside. We were craving some asian fusion korean food but didn't want to travel to STL for it so we stumbled upon Teriyaki Grill on yelp. We read the reviews and looked at the pictures. We noticed there were not many pictures of the restaurant and just pictures of a printed menu on paper that's posted on the wall. I had called to ask if it was carry-out only or if we're able to dine in and of course this little joint is carry-out only. There are no tables or anything what so ever. I read in a review that they have some tables but there's absolutely none now and I wouldn't recommend eating there anyway....it's just plain scary lol. They had so many positive reviews so we were like heck, lets try it out. So i called and placed an order for carry-out. Whenever we arrived....omg it looked so scary, like we were in a broke down part of town. The plaza itself has gone down so much in the past few years. I haven't been on that side of the SAFB gate in many years...

Anyways, we had walked in and it literally looked like an abandon building. Yes it's a quick mart but there wasn't really anything on the shelves. Everything looked sorry and emptied. There was a bag of peanuts hanging on the rack along with some candy and gum. There were mainly drinks and smokes. Then we looked to our left and recognized the little counter where they have the Teriyaki Grill. We were thinking....if we didn't place a carryout order and just walked in to order....we would of most likely walked out since it looked very run down. We paid for our food and left......When we got home, we opened the food and it smelled super delicious! We were ready to eat! 

What we had...
Pork Bulgogi $8.99: This was very well marinated and super delicious! I'm not a huge pork fan but I must say the pork bulgogi was extremely good. It wasn't too dry or tough. It was cooked perfectly! The red sauce was very flavorful and spicy! Something we like!

Nori Tori $8.99: I had no idea what Nori Tori was so I asked the guy and he told me it was basically like Beef Bulgogi. The beef again like the pork was perfectly cooked. Not dried or overcooked. Very flavorful! Something I would definitely get again. I was able to taste the meat and I knew it was beef. You know some places you go and the meat has no flavor, you wouldn't know what they served lol

Chicken bowl $6.39: Again, like both dishes described above....perfectly cook! Whoever is cooking in their Kitchen is doing a great job! They definitely know how to cook and marinate their meats very well. What I liked about the chicken was it was very fresh! You were able to taste the chicken! It was not the rubbery like flavor and not bland at all! The chicken was super good with the sweet and spicy sauce over top.

Overall, I would love to rate this place as a 4.5 star, but the quick mart is just scary looking lol. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place. AMAZING FOOD! Great generous portion! Very flavorful! I'm surprise the owner hasn't expand to another location offering dine in, he would make good $$$. 

Yes, it looks scary on the inside but looks can be deceiving! Like I mention before....if we walked in and judge the place on how it looks...we would have walked out and missed out on some amazing food!

A bit of an odd name really. Because I'm not sure if its meant to be descriptive or ironic in some way.  I do like that its not some random combination of English words that suggest ""asian-ness"" (not a word I know), like Plum Dragon Inn...

Its a little pricey actually, at least on Saturday afternoon (only time we have been). We came here from Baltimore, so its not like sticker shock pricey- its just for what you actually get (unless you are doing crab legs exclusively) you are going to pay $30 for two people to eat a couple plates of basic, and granted okay, buffet food.  The place is clean and the servers are nice if quiet.

We realized today (while at another place) that we had actually gone to Easy on the recommendation of a Mid-Western 70+ year old lady- who goes with her friends.  I can see how Easy would appear exotic and unique to that clientele.  That's not a knock, just a fact. That versus two people who have lived in various places around the world (including Guam, Hawaii, South America, Europe)...""exotic"" is all in the palate of the taster.

The steamed egg and the potato salad were not good and the kimchi was fine but there were like 3 tiny pieces of cabbage there. The Seafood pancake appetizer...It felt like they had previously prepared the pancake with the green onions and just warmed it up with the seafood on top. The seafood turned out to be some large pieces of squid and some very tiny shrimp, you know the kind. It was fine. My Bibim-bob was disappointing in that the rice was not very sticky as Korean rice often is and the portion of Bulgogi (beef) was extremely small. Also the gochujang had been thinned out and was lacking some of its flavor. The spicy pork was good but did not taste as if it had been marinating long and didn't have that sear you want on Korean meat. Nothing was bad.

It arrived on the table all bubbly and packed full of seafood, mushrooms, tofu, and cooked to order. Spicy, but not so that you can't taste the other great flavors. Seafood & vegetable pancake was cooked to perfection. It was so substantial and knowing that it would reheat well, had to put it aside for the sides(banchan). My friends ordered Jabchae (glass noodles with beef and veg) and thoroughly enjoyed it. I've made it at home before and it takes a while to prepare...not to mention the expense cause it takes a lot of ingredients to make it right. This one was just like mom used to make...much better than mine. Another friend ordered Seollongtang (beef/bone broth) soup with rice noodles. It's made for the lighter eaters, who aren't in the mood for heavy spices.  But to get the broth to that milky color, you truly have to spend some time to allow bones to cook.

Rating 1.5 Stars at best for tonight's experience.

They've got so much potential and they could own this side of the river, but if they keep doing what I had tonight I doubt they'll be around in a year. 

NOTHING WE HAD TASTED OR LOOKED FRESH MADE. We did simple stuff - korean kimchi pancake,spicy fried chicken, and a tofu stew - all staples in Korea and stateside Korean restaurants. The kimchi pancake honestly tasted microwaved. It was limp and scorching hot. Spicy fried chicken didn't come out hot (spicy or temperature - how's that possible?), and the best of all three was the tofu stew. The saddest thing though was the common in every Korean joint side dishes of kimchi, veggies, and other things. Here's where the lack of quality really showed - if they told me these little plates had been prepped and sat on a counter since 10am (we ate dinner at 8pm) I would've believed it..this is SO WASY TO DO RIGHT AND BE MEMORABLE!! 

Korean food is the best - something for everyone whether your thing is veggies, meat, sweet, spicy, and again it EASY TO DO RIGHT. It's also TERRIBLE WHEN DONE WRONG. 

Wait staff were great - attentive and nice.

They're also expensive for what you get - at these prices you'll be happier if you drive across the river.",136915,Korean Bobsang,108 Regency Park Dr,O'Fallon,IL,62269,38.5904695,-89.9395238,4.0,42,0,"Korean, Restaurants","{'Tuesday': '16:30-21:30', 'Wednesday': '16:30-21:30', 'Thursday': '16:30-21:30', 'Friday': '16:30-22:0', 'Saturday': '16:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '16:30-21:0'}",True,True,True,True,2,False,False,u'beer_and_wine',True,,True,u'average','casual',False,u'no',True,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,,16:30-21:30,16:30-21:30,16:30-21:30,16:30-22:0,16:30-22:0,16:30-21:0

The beef kimbob was prepared well, with fresh produce, and again a balanced savory flavor. 

Our main dish beef bugolgi was served on a traditional skillet over a bed of onions. The meat is tender and juicy cooked just right with a traditionally sweet mouth watering flavor.

However, when I am still thinking about how bad my experience was a week later, I knew that I had to share on here.  I knew that it was too good to be true to have authentic Korean food in O'Fallon!

My husband and I ate there on a Friday night.  There was a wait at the door and the hostess did not seem to know how long the wait would be.  We were so excited about trying that we waited over 30 minutes to be seated.  Everyone else that was waiting decided to leave.  We just assumed that it was growing pains for being a new restaurant and hung in there.

We ordered the kimchi pancake, spicy fried chicken and ""Korean style"" grilled mackerel.  First, our kimchi pancake was never brought out to us, so I cannot comment on how it tastes.  My husband was having a hard time figuring out what made the mackerel Korean style, aside from the dried seaweed packet that they provided on the side.  And the spicy chicken?  For $17, I was expecting something spectacular.  It was such a disappointment.  It was extremely small portions and I could not taste the spice over the sweetness!  Neither one of us could find that traditional Korean flavor that we were looking for.  The side dishes were also disappointing.

The service was friendly, but incompetent and flustered.  I understand that this is due to being new, but be prepared for a wait to be seated and to get served.

On a day where I was out looking for a place to eat for lunch, I decided on Zapp since the reviews favored this place.  The restaurant was not difficult to find and is located in a main street off I64 across from O'fallon Wal-Mart.   It was about noon and the place had a couple of tables occupied.  I like the small quaint atmosphere that made it more personal service.  The waitress is very friendly and welcoming.  I have a feeling she maybe the owner.  The menu is plentiful for a small restaurant.  It serves Thai and Chinese cuisines.  I am not interested in Chinese since metro east has plenty of which none are worth mentioning.  I had my taste buds for Thai and so ordered the typical beef pad thai with #4 spice.  Before the main entree, I ordered Thai tea and spring rolls.  Lets start with critiquing the tea.  I loved it!!!!  Not the best since I have had Los Angeles better Thai restaurants.  However, their version is not bad and would order again if I decide to return.  I just wish it was in a bigger glass that other restaurants provide.  Now the spring rolls were a different story.  I was not happy with this choice.  I have been to many Thai restaurants and would have to say that this is rank top 3 worst in my opinion.  It was all lettuce and one mint leaf wrapped in the typical spring roll wrapper.  I was looking for shrimp or other form of vegetables.  The sauce was so plain.  I was highly disappointed to say the least.  I will not be ordering this again.  The pad thai came out just in time to rid the bad taste of the rolls.  I was pleased with the appearance and smell.  Good portion for the price.  Taste was decent.  My only complaint is that the noodles were super sticky.  The spice was just right.  I am not impress with the visit.  I would go back again to try something else.  I believe in first impression is a lasting one but not with restaurant food.  I have to go back to try other things.  The service was nice.  Had the service been bad, then I would not return.

The presentation was okay, but the flavor was lacking I don't think there was any crab in them just cream cheese. For the amount of Rangoon noodle there was not enough to fill it. Very disappointed in this appetizer but not the worst I've had.

I had the Veggie Lo Mein, this was AMAZING, not to salty like most that i get from thai places.  I would definitely get this again, the portion for dinner was enough for my lunch the next day.

The lunches are all always $7.50 and the dinner is always $9.00 for everything on the menu, i like that touch, everywhere you always go has different prices for chicken, beef etc...not this place!

My hubby got the Green Curry Chicken, he thought it was delicious, that the curry had  a great taste, he did get the hot and he was definitely sweating.

As far as the service, i think the lady was cooking as well as waiting on tables, it took a while to get to place our order and we had to get her attention for water refills, napkins and for our check.  

Based on the services and the crab rangoon this place is like a 4 1/2 but i just can't push it to the 5 because the rangoon didn't just WOW me.

Papaya salad: get it level 5 heat if you tolerate spicy was. 

Chicken and shrimp Pineapple fried rice: very sweet and moist. It's not dry like most places. 

Shrimp Pad Thai: it's also sweet and moist. Not dry. I'm not a pad Thai fan since most places make it really dry. Zap noodle doesnt.

Beef Panang curry: they over did it on the coconut milk but it's not to bad.

Shrimp tempura: the batter is very fresh and crispy. Shrimp is very flavorful.

We chose Zapp because it is right across the street from the Sams Club. We had been there once before but it had been a while. 

I went with the Ramen Soup. It had chicken, vegetables, and noodles in a savory broth. I ordered a 1 spice. It is customary for Thai restaurants to spice from 1-5. My father ordered the Drunken Noodles. It's a flat rice noodle with seafood and vegetables in a spicy chili sauce. He asked for a 2.5 spice. Apparently these were lunch specials and came with 2 crab rangoon which were brought out prior to the meal. The crab rangoon were your basic packaged frozen appetizer. They served them with a sweet chili sauce that was delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and heat. My Ramen Noodle Soup was not the most exciting menu choice but it was exactly what I wanted at that moment. It was one of the first freezing winter days and it was hot and savory and comforting. My father loved his Drunken Noodles. He felt it was spiced exactly right and he really liked the mussels in the dish.

We started with chicken pot stickers, because dumplings are my secret weakness (well darn, now everyone knows).  I had Drunken Noodles with tofu and asked for it spicy, she had the Lard Na and said capsaicin terrified her.  Children split an order of rice and a chicken with lo mein, and we later added a soup.

The pot stickers were probably frozen, and middle-of-the-road.  All other dishes were great *except* the Lard Na, which had excellent meat and vegetable, BUT was floating on a sea of goopy gravy.

She was very snide with him, telling him to take our orders as we were looking at menus to get our food to-go, after we had already talked to him. To the young guy there if you're reading this, just quit. There's better jobs that will treat you with more respect. 

2. Our food was disappointingly bland. Not much flavor whatsoever, and no spice level. We ordered a spice level of 3 and it was more like a zero. Why did my wife & I need to add red pepper flakes to get any sort of heat????

Food: 1:5
Pricing: 2:5
Service 1:5

When I set down at my table, the restaurant was mostly empty. I asked the waiter if the dumplings were made in-house, or purchased elsewhere. He told me they were made in house so I decided to try it. I received dumplings that tasted the same as the frozen, made in Vietnam variety that I see at my local Asian supermarket.  It was terrible. 

I ordered a shrimp dish as the entrée and the shrimps where we under cooked. I took a bite and realize they were still half raw and spit it placed it on my plate. I notified the waiter. He took it back, I'm guessing they picked out the shrimp, nuked it, and then put it back in the bowl. The raw shrimp that I spit out in the corner of the plate was still there. I would have though they would at least have cleaned that off.

It was overall a poor dining experience. It's very seldom that I don't leave a tip, but because I felt like the waiter lied to me about the dumplings, and because of the grossly under cooked shrimp, I decided this dining experience was not worth a tip.

I live in St. Louis, MO so whenever I'm on the other side of the river in Illinois it's my go to spot. The O'fallon location is in a little strip mall, not far off 64. They are always nice and I've never had to wait to get a table. They may tell you to pick where you want to sit. There isn't a formal hostess station when you walk in. It's got a small town vibe, by that I mean if you go there enough they will remember you which is nice. Parking isn't a problem, large parking lot. There's also an orange leaf next door if you want ice cream after. 

Back to the pad thai, you can pick chicken, tofu, pork or beef. You can also get it spicy/hot. They have a scale, I think it's 1-5.

Likely the  BEST Chicken Wing Place in the Metro East. Why?  Fresh Hot and Flavorful!
I would definitely say give them a try. 
IMO far better than any of the other Metro East Chicken/Wing places.
We tried 3 Variations (with plenty to take home!)
1.) Bone in ""BB Wings"" Amazingly flavorful breaded/fried that tastes better than that ""other place ""  (You know Sounds like ""Bopeyes"" )

2.)Honey Garlic (Tried the Boneless) Crispy poppin' with Garlic Sweet/Soy Flavor

3.)Secret Spicy Think Sweet n Spicy Flavor Explosion in your Mouth! (You may need a bib!) 

What Sets them apart :  bone in are meaty as they should be but the boneless stand out compared to other Wild Wing places little dried up excuse for a boneless wing. Larger More meaty pieces that far more flavorful.

She also enjoyed the side of ""So Ddeok So Ddeok""

Diverse menu that includes Lunch Plate combos as well as Sandwiches. 
Unique Sides include Pickled Radish 
And Ramen Noodle Bowls! (A Nice add!)

This was obviously too much food but we like variety and had a considerable to-go box when we left. We both loved everything but I would say I favored the Sweet Spicy chicken sauce over the Gang-Jeong. It had just a little more heat. The Gang-Jeong was more of a sweet and spicy soy and I just love the other which tasted more like gochujang. We both loved the Ddeok-Bokki, especially my father because he had never had it!

I kid you not, I went to this place to get dinner the day I heard about it because I was so excited to try it! I'm happy to say that they did not disappoint. The restaurant is about 25 minutes away from where I am, so I called in my order and the timing was perfect--food was going to be ready in about 20 minutes. Not a short drive, but definitely worth it. We got the BB and Gangnam wings and cheeseling and gang jung boneless. Loved the crisp on the BB wings and they had the perfect kick in them, just enough to feel a little heat that builds as you eat. The Gangnam was definitely my least favorite; it was flavorful but I wasn't a fan and probably will not order that one again. Cheeseling was a nice, mild flavor that is different: cheesy and crunchy and slightly sweet on the back end. Gang Jung was hands down my favorite. It's a popular flavor in Korea and this one was almost as good as what I've had in Seoul. I will be back to get more of these. Sticky sweet and crispy--the perfect boneless bite. 

It's a bit of a hike but it was well worth it. I'm going to have to try the honey garlic next time; was eyeing that one but figured we'd already ordered plenty for the night.

If you're going to eat fried chicken, might as well eat the best!  You know how sometimes you order a sandwich, a burger, or a steak and when you get it , it doesn't look like the picture?  You feel a little let down, but you tell yourself, you didn't need such a big sandwich, all the fat, the calories anyway...and yet you feel a little cheated?   Well, look at the pictures in their menu and that's what you get!!!!  It's so exciting. 

Since they opened in September, We've been here nearly once a week. We've tried the crispy, yet soft bites of Golden Original boneless, Secret Spicy with its sticky sweet, yet crispy goodness, and a wake up your mouth hot, Hot Spicy, and  oh yeah, flavor town Honey Garlic.  It's amazing how they're crispy on the outside when you start biting into it, but gives you a satisfying pieces of juicy chicken to bite off. It's hard to describe.   If you like your chicken not so crispy on the outside, try the Gangnam style..  it's got lots of flavor without the crunch. 

Our favorite that has become our go to is the half and half boneless.  It's a little too much for the two of us, but the leftovers are heavenly!  Even cold, the secret and the hot spicy is soooo goood. 

Oh and the bowls!!!  They're amazing. If you're not in the mood for meat, try the bowls and the sandwiches. I have been told that the chicken sandwich is the better than any he's had.

First off, I need to give a shout out to the complimentary pickled white radish that comes with the fried chicken. Such a great side/palate cleanser/snack. As for the star, the fried chicken, I've tried both the wings and the whole chicken with bone. The fry on everything is excellent. There's a solid, audible crunch to the flaky exterior, and the chicken inside is always is juicy and tender.

For the whole chicken, I typically get the 1/2 golden original and 1/2 secret spicy combo. Golden original has the best crunch, but I prefer the secret spicy for the flavor of the sauce. It's mostly sweet and not very spicy.

For the wings, I definitely recommend the honey garlic and soy garlic flavors. I've tried the Gangnam style wings before as well, but I would pass. It has a decent black pepper sauce, but it's just not as flavorful or crispy as the other options.

My friend and I ordered online and selected the 'pay with cash' option. We went downstairs (we live in a dorm) and waited for half an hour for our food. We decided to call and they told us that they had other deliveries so it may take a while. We waited for another half an hour (wait totaled about an hour at this point) and called again. The woman on the phone asked for our information and immediately got hostile and said we did not pay for our food so the delivery person left. When my friend said that we were waiting for over an hour, she responded ""well if you want your order it'll be another forty-five minutes. Are you actually gonna pay this time?"" She then hung up on my friend who was almost in tears at the end of the conversation.
I decided that I wasn't giving money to a business that treated its costumers that way so I called back and politely said that my friend was just treated badly on the phone so we would like to cancel the order to which the woman responds, ""I am the manager so you don't need to be rude to me! I already cancelled the order!"" and she hung up. Again.
If the manager of China King is this impolite, I would hate to see how rude the rest of the employees are.

If this was the first time this had happened, I wouldn't bother typing all this out. But this happens every, single, time and I think we're finally done with this. It's just unacceptable. So I'm writing this to try and save others a similarly large annoyance of ordering dinner at a reasonable time and not getting it until almost 2 hours later. I'm telling you this from experience. Every time we get to the point of thinking that they must have forgotten us, we call and they say the driver has already left. So I don't know... again the food is good, but do yourself a favor and go there to eat. Ordering for delivery is a couple hour ordeal.",149965,Orient,1518 Troy Rd,Edwardsville,IL,62025,38.7946374,-89.9504718,4.0,36,1,"Chinese, Restaurants","{'Monday': '11:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-21:0'}",True,True,,False,2,False,True,u'full_bar',True,False,True,u'quiet',u'casual',True,u'no',True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,True,False,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-21:0,11:0-22:0,11:0-22:0,16:0-21:0

Ordered over phone for pick up, kid in front was polite. Got home to discover I had some beef cube order instead of General Tao Chicken.  Call back to explain the situation and could hear the manager yelling (not in English) and arguing that she double checked the order and put GTC on the box, which was there, and just couldn't believe I could have possibly the wrong order.  That took about 5 minutes to explain over and over, to the point I was ready to take all food back for my money back, but the family had already started to dig in.  I brought the wrong order back, they had correct order to go for me, manager would not come out of the back to speak of the situation. 

- Fried rice has egg in it which I like
- Crab Rangoon is envelope style and a bit fried too much with little filling...tough to tear into
- wonton soup was great I think, GF had it
- got a perfect fit fortune from cookie

One aftrn I called in an order 30 min prior to leaving my house. I hadn't eaten yet for tht day and I had a vball sports event to attend in O'Fallon. I planned to take a box of shrimp fried rice with me while driving directly there frm home/Edw. I expected the food to be ready but whn I arrived at The Orient the place was empty and when I walked in thts when the counter person turned in my order into their cook. Did they expect I wudnt show up? They expected me to stand there and wait. This happened only from me giving them my phone nmbr when I called my order in. I'm only person at my nmbr and I've never not picked up an order or had any trbl b4. I had given myself enuf time to pick up order and drive to my granddaughters event to arrive on time. I resented being treated this way so I cancelled my order. I don't spend my money where I don't get treated with respect and get good service. Since tht day I believe whn I give my Phn nmbr I get fried rice made with 1-2 day old rice. It doesn't look fresh. So now I don't go there anymore.
